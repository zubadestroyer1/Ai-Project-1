:
Heliconias
are
a
genus
of
flowering
plants
in
the
monotypic
family
with
more
than
150
species
globally.
Native
cultures
across
the
Amazon
use
heliconia
leaves
to
make
a
dish
called
maito,
wherein
they
wrap
various
foods
in
these
leaves
and
cook
them
over
fire
or
in
water.
Some
species
of
heliconia
produce
edible
fruits
that
are
similar
to
bananas,
but
tend
to
be
less
favorable
because
they
contain
more
seeds
and
are
less
sweet
than
widely
cultivated
banana
species.
The
flowers
of
the
heliconias
create
nurseries
for
mosquito
larvae
and
tadpoles,
and
are
important
sources
of
nectar
for
many
hummingbirds
and
insects.
Because
of
their
striking
flowers
and
bold
foliage,
heliconias
are
important
ornamental
flowers
in
any
tropical
garden.

many
plants
in
the
Amazon
rainforest.
Typically

12,"Curare
:
Chondrodendron
tomentosum:
Curare
is
a
South
American
vine
native
to
the
Amazon
basin.
This
woody
vine
can
grow
to
the
top
of
canopies
and
live
more
than
100
years,
and
can
exceed
8
inches
in
diameter
at
the
base.
Its
large
heart-shaped
leaves
have
a
soft
silky
underside
made
up
of
tiny
white
hairs,
giving
the
plant
the
common
name
of
velvet
leaf.
It
has
both
male
and
female
flowers
which
are
small,
greenish-white,
and
grow
in
clusters.
The
vernacular
name
of
this
plant
is
derived
from
two
Tupi
native
terms
meaning
""bird""
and
""to
kill.""
The
curare
venom
used
in
hunting
is
a
combination
of
many
plant
species,
in
which
the
recipe
varies
from
tribe
to
tribe.
The
curare
vine
is
the
primary
ingredient
in
all
recipes.
The
vine
is
mashed/grated
and
then
put
through
a
sieve
to
extract
the
liquid.
This
liquid
is
then
cooked
into
a
concentrate
and
the
darts
of
the
blowguns
are
dipped
into
this
extract.
Death
from
curare
poison
is
caused
by
asphyxia
(respiratory
arrest)
because
the
muscles
become
so
relaxed
that
the
muscles
operating
the
diaphragm
and
lungs
stop
functioning.
Interestingly,
it
only
works
if
the
poison
gets
into
the
bloodstream;
ingesting
curare
poison
(and
even
eating
the
meat
of
curare-poisoned
animals)
has
no
toxic
effect
since
it
isn't
absorbed
in
the
stomach.
The
blowgun
is
made
from
the
Chonta
palm
and
the
darts
are
made
from
the
stem
of
a
big
palm
that
grows
from
the
ground
up.
They
fasten
a
piranha
tooth
at
the
tip
of
the
dart
so
that
if
the
dart
breaks
off,
the
tooth
remains
in
the
animal’s
body
and
thus
the
poison
remains
in
the
animal’s
body.
